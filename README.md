# The C-TRUS Dataset

To advance research on colon wall segmentation, we provide a novel dataset of transabdominal ultrasound images from patients with ulcerating colitis. We name the dataset C-TRUS for **C**olon Wall Segmentation in **Tr**ansabdominal **U**ltra**s**ound.

The data was collected with a Toshiba Xario General LCD. The dataset consists of 827 images of size 580x360 pixels, which were extracted from ultrasound sequences of 13 patients. The recorded ultrasound sequences resemble clinical transabdominal ultrasound procedures for ulcerating colitis. The image content is therefore not restricted to images showcasing the colon wall but also includes images from a colon localization phase, containing other transabdominal views.
